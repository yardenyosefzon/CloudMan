This simple website offers a minimalist yet elegant UI for interacting with WeatherAPI.
By utilizing the API, you can access the most up-to-date weather data for cities worldwide.
Allow Mr. Cloud, the guardian of the site, to guide you in determining whether you've successfully located your desired city.

To run the project, clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies, and then enter "npm start" in the command line
for the frontend and "nodemon index" for the backend.

Enjoy!
